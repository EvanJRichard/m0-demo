# Example Token Demo

This started as a demo completed through the Cyfrin Foundry & Solidity course to brush up on my foundry. I then tried to demo a rebasing token, but ran out of time - best to post the WIP incomplete code. The idea was to use ChainLink to call `rebase()` monthly. It still shows how I structure my foundry projects, what code styles I try to follow, etc.

# Thank you!

Thanks Patrick Collins, your classes are great.
